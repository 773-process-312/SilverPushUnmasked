				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Zoomdeck</font></strong> is an innovative platform for great conversations around photos. By letting you add interactive tags to any photo, Zoomdeck enables meaningful conversations  right there on the photo.</p>
				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Deepak Prakash  </font></strong>has been hacking since he was 12. A few years back, he picked up a passion for photography and a combination of the two led to the idea for Zoomdeck. He was one of the first members of Apache Design India R&D team and spent 4.5 years developing algorithms and data structures to model complex chip designs. He has been placed in the top 200 at Google Code Jam and is also a recipient of Seagate photography award.
