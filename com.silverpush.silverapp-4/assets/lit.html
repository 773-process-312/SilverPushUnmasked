				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Little Eye Labs</font></strong> is building the next generation of tools for mobile app developers. Its innovative tools provide easy visualization of the inner workings of a mobile app, enabling insights like never before  the mobile app equivalent of a CT scanner.
</p>
				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Kumar </font></strong>Born on the same month as the Homebrew Computers club, which inspired both the Steves in their journey to find Apple, Kumar had his first stint in entrepreneurship around the age of 14, when he and his friend started a local lending library, which ultimately shutdown before finding a single customer. It took him another 23 odd years before the desire to do something on his own resurfaced. Bored of working in large corporations for the initial 13 years of his career and 3 patents later (all in the area of developer tools, 1 of which he hates), he joined a startup. But then the corporate world refused to let him go. The startup was acquired and he ended up back in a corporate job. Long story short, 2012 came, fate intervened, founded little eye labs alongwith his friends, who shared his vision of building a world class product company focussed on solving problems for the new generation of mobile app developers. His random thoughts can be heard @kumrr

</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Lakshman</font> </strong> Ask Lakshman what his mother tongue is and pat comes the response C++. He fell in love with compilers and tools during his B. Tech, decided he would do a Masters in CS and scored 10th rank India wide in GATE. In the 15 years of career after Masters from IISc, he has dabbled in diverse fields as well as multiple roles across various organizations like IBM, Rational, Yahoo! and Adobe. With Little Eye Labs, he returns to his first love,  tool development. This is not his first leap of faith, he has leaped off a plane before (solo sky diving) once and bungee jumping multiple times. Safe and successful landing in all those times gave him enough confidence to take on a bigger challenge! He is at his vocal best @lay_man

</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Satyam</font></strong> is the secret sauce at little eye labs. He was a committer of Eclipse, a product used by millions of developers world over. Known for his persistence, he continued at Rational/IBM for 13 years resisting the lure of various lucrative opportunities. Finally, Kumar made him an offer he could not refuse  the opportunity of working with his best friends and an opportunity to create a world class product company from India. He is passionate about the quality of products he develops and is well respected among his peers for his work ethic. He has a Masters from IIT, Kgp and multiple patents, and he can be reached @ksatyam
