				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>HackerEarth</font></strong>  is an innovative platform that aim to put real-world programming at the center of the tech-hiring process, making for swifter and cost-effective hiring. The SaaS product allows Engineering Managers to create online programming tests across several programming languages and platforms. The applicant code is compiled, tested, and evaluated using a range of metrics to help companies filter candidates quickly and accurately.
</p>
				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Sachin </font></strong> believes he was destined to be a hacker. He never showed interest in programming until he entered IIT Roorkee, where he finally realized that he was made to do nothing else. He has published two research papers in parallel programming, built a learning platform for budding programmers with over 100K unique users in the first month of launch, interned with Microsoft in its cloud technology group, and finally worked at Google after graduation. These diverse experiences have helped Sachin strike a balance between rapid prototyping and engineering excellence. Sachin is the growth hacker here, reaching out to smart techies who are looking to build great engineering teams. And, if you are up coding till 3 a.m., be sure to have his self-patented masala chai. Give him a shout @sachingupta006</p>
				<br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Vivek</font> </strong>Nothing gets Vivek more excited than being thrown a challenge, especially one that involves programming. Also, nothing makes him more angry than a bad experience given to a fellow programmer. He will just roll up his sleeves and fix it. While at IIT Roorkee, he led several teams to ensure excellent intranet infrastructure and builder tools for all students. He has roots in the open source world and has contributed code and effort to operating systems such as Minix. He loves building developer friendly tools that improve the online programming experience. He has interned at Amazon and Google Summer of Code, where he worked on cloud technology and system programming. He is obsessed about engaging millions of developers on HackerEarth and observes every move they make on the platform. Even his self-coded simple weekend hack for compiling & running code online gathered 25,000 compilations in the first week! He loves engaging people with ideas on new technologies. Reach out to him @vivekprakash
