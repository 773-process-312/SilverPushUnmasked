				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Exit10|GamesInc</font></strong> allows consumers to trade-up their electronic goods at their doorstep. Exit10 makes new products affordable to its customers by monetizing their existing ones, which are then resold or recycled. Its GamesINC portal has established itself as the #1 buying, selling, and certification site for video games in India. Exit10 is currently expanding to new categories with broader appeal.</p>
				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Alex </font></strong>is the born entrepreneur. He first dabbled with entrepreneurship by writing and editing a video game magazine at the age of 11, and coding his first game at 13. Alex followed this streak by leading his region Scout unit, trying to reduce drug abuse on the streets of Cairo and Tehran, and leading a team that trained managers in the New Orleans administration after Katrina. After a few years in the consulting wilderness, Alex found his spark again when Saps approached him with the challenge of resolving the high cost and poor supply of electronics in India.</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Saps</font> </strong>is the rockstar in the team. The first signs of his behaviour started when he drove his Dads jeep off a cliff at the age of 10. He graduated to actual rockstar-dom when he picked up the axe for heavy metal bands in college and played to thousands of adoring fans. Having gone through the society-induced consulting hangover in his 20s, he is back to his original roots with Exit10. Together with Alex, Saps set about solving one of the most difficult questions online consumers face today: how can we afford that fancy iPad without selling a kidney?
