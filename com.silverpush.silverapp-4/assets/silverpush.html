				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>SilverPush</font></strong> is the first company to allow app owners and ad networks to intelligently connect with mobile users. Until now, app owners have struggled to monetize their apps due to infrequent usage, while brands have been reluctant to advertise on mobile due to limited user data. SilverPush algorithms analyze multiple sources of data, and identify the most lucrative opportunities to deliver targeted content to users via push notifications, SMS, email and more.</p>
				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Abhishek </font></strong>was born to code. As a child, he spent his evenings dreaming of becoming a software engineer. Nothing was going to stop him. Despite spending the last 4 years building and taking technology products to scale, he began his journey from humble beginnings &#8211; failing every single java class in college and initial professional trainings. It was not until he had the opportunity to build the largest school management ERP solution for India with Libsys did he develop a passion and aptitude for the language. Now you will find him burning the midnight oil in pursuit of increasing the engagement of apps and taking SilverPush global.

</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Hitesh</font> </strong>is no stranger to pushing himself beyond normal limits. Always knowing he wanted to be an entrepreneur, he deliberately worked in Australia to gain a global perspective and trained at companies that allowed him to analyze complex data sets. In 2011, he ventured into entrepreneurship by cofounding Wisetouch, a platform for digital outdoor media properties, and now SilverPush. As the CEO of SilverPush, Hitesh believes in the power of intelligently using data to drive business growth.

</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Mudit</font></strong> is a strategy guy by education, but sales guy by nature. After working with leading digital media companies such as AdGlobal360 and Tyroo Media, he has learnt the art of selling you your own shirt. He excels in the digital marketing space and believes in making long term professional relationships in the industry. In 2011, he co-founded Wisetouch, and closed multiple deals with major outdoor media companies in India. Mudit is an MBA degree and only think about creating business value and money. He has a passion for long drives and takes off to a hillstation whenever gets the chance</p>
