				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>EmployeeSocial</font></strong> is India is first and only cloud-based social rewards system. Integrated with a powerful enterprise social network and a corporate price store, EmployeeSocial enables organizations to manage employee loyalty and engagement seamlessly.
				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Bhavik Rathod </font></strong>From the time Bhavik completed his MBA from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, his mind started whirling with thousands of entrepreneurial ideas. He started by creating a folder on his laptop called My Entrepreneurial Ideas and is now a co-founder and CEO at EmployeeSocial, one of the ideas that excited him the most. It took him 6 years after the cliche consulting stints at Ernst & Young, Atos and Motorola to realize that he was never meant to make it big by giving advice to others. Dedicated to change the way employees are rewarded in their organization, Bhavik dreams of reaching a target of 1 million badges to be rewarded through EmployeeSocial.

</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Anuraj Jain</font> </strong>Anuraj entrepreneurship journey started from his hostel room in IIM Lucknow where he created a budget travel blog to help people like him find flights and hotels abroad for as less as $5. After spending 5 years in the corporate sector mingling with India’s booming service class, he realized that every other person he came across was unhappy with his work environment. Usually found reading techcrunch and mashable articles on his tab, Anuraj set out with his co-disruptors to create the Next-Gen employee rewards program. You will often hear him saying, “Loyalty is a two way street!”

</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Taranath Jawahar</font></strong> At just 26 years of age, he is called the young gun at EmployeeSocial. Known for his high risk appetite, he jumped into a startup right after graduation and created promotions for brands like Nokia, P&G, ING Vysya and Pernod Ricard. His creativity has reached more than 1 Crore people across India through exciting loyalty programs for banks, special offers at retail chains, sweepstakes and some whacky promotions where customers got a free haircut with a detergent. Though an engineer by education, he found his calling in alliances and partnerships and he customizes the product portfolio himself at EmployeeSocial.</p>
