				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Zapr</font></strong>makes television advertisements interactive. Its innovative platform helps brands identify and engage personally with ad-viewers in real-time. Through Zapr, anyone can seamlessly interact with their favorite brands, discover fresh content and dive into a fun and gamified environment.

</p>
				<p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Deepak  </font></strong> is a fitness enthusiast, Goa-phile, ex-consultant and an entrepreneur. He spent 4 years at IIT Madras exploring the mysteries of biotechnology and genetics. He opted out of a career in research and over the next few years completed his MBA from IIM Ahmedabad and advised global corporations as a consultant. However, given the calling of his marwari genes, he jumped the consulting bandwagon and joined forces with Sajo and Sandipan to build Zapr.

</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Sajo</font> </strong> is a musician, naval architect, economist and technopreneur. He graduated from IIT Kharagpur and following his MBA from IIM Ahmedabad, travelled extensively across India as consultant for Feedback Infrastructure. The five years at IIT Kharagpur had ignited his love for technology and when the opportunity of Zapr came along, he promptly joined his IIM-A batch-mates to follow his passion of building innovative customer-facing tech products. He is driving forward Zapr technology initiatives.



</p><br><p><strong><font color=#03A0F5>Sandipan</font></strong> is an amateur pastry chef, marketer and entrepreneur. After spending five years in the US, in 2008 he had a swades moment and knew it was time to return home. He spent the next few years pursuing his MBA at IIM-A, exploring possible business ideas and finally took the entrepreneurial plunge in late 2011. He has previously worked as a marketer and a consultant, with Nestle, Accenture and Essex Lake Group, across India, USA and Germany.</p>
