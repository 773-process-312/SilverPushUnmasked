# Testing High Freq Response in YouTube

This folder contains a simple (dirty) Ableton set generating a start and end reference tone (audible). Between the test tones at:

* ~16khz
* ~18.2khz
* ~19khz
* ~20khz
* ~23khz

A video is posted at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RegvOoy-n7k

Software used:

* Ableton 9.2.2 generation and audio render.
* Camtasia (screen capture)

Audio was rendered via Ableton @44.1khz / 16bit (CD quality) and placed in test video (was not sampled via screen capture).

No additional processing was added.

The goal is to create a units of audio from YouTube to compare to the original audio located at:

* ```SilverPushUnmasked/Research_high_freq_in_youtube/testtones Project/RENDER/testtones2.wav```.
